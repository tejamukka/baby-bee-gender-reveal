# 🚀 Real RSVP Setup for GitHub Pages

## Current Issue
The current RSVP system uses localStorage, which means:
- Each user only sees their own RSVPs
- Counts are not shared between users
- You can't see all submissions from all users

## Solution: Formspree Integration

### Step 1: Set up Formspree (5 minutes)
1. Go to [formspree.io](https://formspree.io)
2. Create a free account
3. Create a new form
4. Copy your form endpoint (looks like: `https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID`)

### Step 2: Update the Website
Replace the current form action in `index.html`:

```html
<!-- Change this line: -->
<form class="rsvp-form" id="rsvpForm" action="#" method="POST">

<!-- To this: -->
<form class="rsvp-form" id="rsvpForm" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST">
```

### Step 3: Update JavaScript
Replace the localStorage submission with real form submission in `script.js`:

```javascript
// Replace the current form handler with:
rsvpForm.addEventListener('submit', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    
    // Show loading state
    const submitBtn = this.querySelector('.submit-btn');
    const originalText = submitBtn.textContent;
    submitBtn.textContent = 'Submitting... 🐝';
    submitBtn.disabled = true;
    
    // Submit to Formspree
    fetch(this.action, {
        method: 'POST',
        body: new FormData(this),
        headers: {
            'Accept': 'application/json'
        }
    })
    .then(response => {
        if (response.ok) {
            showRSVPSuccess();
            showNotification('RSVP submitted successfully! 🎉', 'success');
        } else {
            throw new Error('Submission failed');
        }
    })
    .catch(error => {
        showNotification('Failed to submit RSVP. Please try again.', 'error');
        submitBtn.textContent = originalText;
        submitBtn.disabled = false;
    });
});
```

## Benefits of Formspree Integration:
✅ **Real shared data**: All RSVPs go to your email
✅ **Central tracking**: You see all submissions in one place
✅ **Email notifications**: Get notified for each RSVP
✅ **Data export**: Download all RSVPs as CSV
✅ **Spam protection**: Built-in spam filtering
✅ **Free tier**: 50 submissions/month free

## Alternative: Google Sheets Integration
For a more advanced solution with real-time shared counts:

1. Create a Google Sheet
2. Use Google Apps Script to create an API
3. Update the website to read/write to the sheet
4. This gives you real-time shared counts visible to all users

## Current Demo Mode
The current system works great for:
- Testing the website
- Showing the functionality
- Local demonstrations

But for a real event, you'll want to use Formspree or Google Sheets integration.

## Next Steps:
1. Set up Formspree account
2. Update the form action
3. Test with real submissions
4. You'll receive all RSVPs via email!
